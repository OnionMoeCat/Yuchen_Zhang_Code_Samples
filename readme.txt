Here is code files for the Graphics class in Graphics Project in my game engine. 

Files:
Graphics.h, Graphics.cpp header/common implementation for the Graphics class
Direct3D/Graphics.cpp Direct3D implementation for the Graphics class
OpenGL/Graphics.cpp OpenGL implementation for the Graphics class

The function of the Graphic class: 
The definition of interfaces of Graphics module to the others parts of the engine

The function of Graphics project: load and render meshes. 
Users could customize Shaders, Effects, and Materials used when rendering meshes.
It works under both Direct3D and OpenGL.

As only part of a library, the code sample is not standalone runnable. The project is too large for a code sample.

This sample represents my skills in software engineer and computer graphics.
